  # Fix video generations RLS policy for manual activities

  1. Policy Updates
    - Update INSERT policy to allow video generation for manual activities
    - Ensure users can create video generations for their own manual activities
    - Maintain existing security for runs and achievements

  2. Security
    - Users can only create video generations for their own content
    - Supports manual activities, runs, and achievements
    - Maintains data isolation between users
